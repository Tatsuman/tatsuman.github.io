	                <p style="color: white;">Rhythm and exaggeration: Tex Avery cartoons exhibit maddening speed and an inexhaustible amount of gags. There is such of an overload of visual and narrative information that it is somewhat tiring to watch a long session of his cartoons. This method of performing gags ridiculously fast makes even mild or dry gags seem hilarious due to their speed.</p>

	                <h2>Reflexivity</h2>
	                <p>Avery's cartoons contain a large amount of reflexivity because they acknowledge they are cartoons. The characters are always conscious of this fact and frequently use this to their advantage. This effectively distances the audience from the animated world and shows how blatantly artificial it is. By alerting the audience that it is obviously watching a cartoon, Avery changes the perspective from a story in another world into a chaotic upheaval of images come to life. He does this with a variety of methods, including blatant signs, dialogues between the characters and the audience, and even having characters run off the film strip.</p>

	                <p>The laws of nature are transformed in Avery cartoons to the point where they show little resemblance to actual physical laws. Similarly, figuration is so bizarre that it is clear the resulting animated world is very distant from our own. The choices for how nature acts are of the moment, always changing, and usually unexpected.

	                <h2>Anti Disney</h2>
	                <p>Avery's style of directing broke the mold of strict realism established by Walt Disney, and encouraged animators to stretch the boundaries of the medium to do things in a cartoon that could not be done in the world of live-action film. An often-quoted line about Avery's cartoons was, "In a cartoon you can do anything," and his cartoons often did just that.

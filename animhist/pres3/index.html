					<p>“Mighty Mouse: The New Adventures” (1987) produced by <strong>Ralph Bakshi</strong> and directed by <strong>John  Kricfalusi</strong> would be the first brief attempt at something stylistically and conceptually different in televised animation, while harkening back to classic, “cartoony” cartoons.</p>
				</section>

					<p>While shortlived, Mighty Mouse not only served as a melting pot of talent of animators and directors who would go on to find success in the later decades, but also as a departure from standard Hanna Barbera and toy-merchandising formulas.</p>

					<p>The premiere of Nicktoons in 1991 would officially mark the beginning of creatordriven television animation with KlaskyCsupo’s “Rugrats,” Jim Jinkin’s “Doug” and most significantly, John K’s “Ren and Stimpy.”</p>

					<p>“Ren and Stimpy” became a sensation, and showed that subversive, bizarre and twisted animation could be successful. It appealed not only to kids for its grossout, comedic tones, but to adults for the off the wall, surreal writing and style.</p>

					<p>One unique trend started by Ren and Stimpy was the <strong>“The Gross-Up Close-Up”</strong> which consisted of highly rendered, super disgusting closeups.</p>

The darker tones and sophisticated content proved animation could carry a more serious, action driven look and style. Largely developed by Bruce Timm, the style referenced classic Fleischer Superman cartoons yet gave a unique, creatordriven stamp on one of DC’s more iconic superheros.</p>

					<p>During the 2000s, a variety of factors emerged that would end the 2D revival and Renaissance boom of the 1990s. In addition to the popularity of cheap anime being imported, the recession and popularity of more cheaply produced liveaction shows (Hannah Montana, etc) in centivised studios to cut back on original animated programming.</p>

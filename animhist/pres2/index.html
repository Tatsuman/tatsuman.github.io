					<p>In the mid to late 1920s, Fischinger continued to experiment with multiple projection techniques and film experimentation, and moved to Berlin in
1927. There, he continued to create abstract films, finding distribution in
theaters internationally throughout Europe and in Japan and the US. He
also did a number of commercials and advertisements.</p>

					<p style="color:white; text-shadow: 1px 1px #24008c">The last phase of Fischinger's career in the 1940s 50s focused what he called "Motion Picture Paintings" working on panes of glass and filming his painting process brushstroke by brushstroke.</p>

					<p>As his health failed, he continued to paint and take the occasional ad work, including a series for Muntz television in the 1950s.
However, he slowly moved away from his personal experimental work, and died in 1967 at the age of 66.</p>

					<p style="color: white;">Frustrated in his filmmaking, Fischinger turned increasingly to oil painting as a creative outlet. Although the Guggenheim Foundation specifically requested a cel animation film, Fischinger made his Bach film Mostion Painting No.1 (1947) as a documentation of the act of painting, taking a single frame each time he made a brush stroke—and the multi-layered style merely parallels the structure of the Bach music without any tight synchronization. Although he never again received funding for any of his personal films</p>

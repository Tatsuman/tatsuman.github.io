                    <h3>Manifesto</h3>
                        <p>Have you ever spoiled food in your fridge? You know your food going to expire tomorrow but don't know what to cook with it? We don't want to waste our food and money. Instant foods are another choice but we still want to eat proper food.
                        You may tried to find a recipe on web, but recipe on websites are too advanced. We don't want to put too much time and effort for food just for one.</p>
